This repository contains network traces that describe GOOSE communications in a substation. The reference one-diagram used for generating the network traces is shown in Figure 1. It consists of 4-buses, and 18 LEDs. The line feeders (1-6) are connected to different loads while the rest of the feeders connect to other nearby substations to provide redundancy. The IEDs communicate among themselves using the GOOSE protocol defined in the IEC 61850 standard. Based on the substation diagram, we consider three scenarios to generate the network traces

__1. Normal Scenario __

__2. Disturbance Scenario __

__3. Attack Scenario __



Each folder in this repository represents one scenario and containsï¼š 
	1. One pcap file: captures GOOSE packets from 18 IEDs during 10 mins. 
	2. 18 csv files: list transmitted data from 18 IEDs at every second during 10 mins.

But the attacking scenario is based on normal scenario's trasmission traffic, so there is no specific CSV in Attack folder.
